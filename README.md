🌌 Design and Simulation of Satellite Attitude Control System 🚀
Using State-Space Modelling, Feedback Control, and State Estimation
📖 Project Overview
This project explores the design and simulation of a satellite attitude control system using advanced control techniques. We utilize state-space modeling, PID feedback control, and state estimation (Kalman Filter) to stabilize and control the satellite's Roll, Pitch, and Yaw angles.

✨ Key Features:

Mathematical modeling of satellite dynamics using state-space representation.
Implementation of state feedback control with a 2-DOF PID controller.
Kalman Filter for robust state estimation.
